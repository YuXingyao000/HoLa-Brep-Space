A cylinder with a flat circular top and bottom, smooth edges, and a uniform thickness.
Design a small, flat cylinder with a circular top and bottom. The cylinder is compact, measuring just over half an inch in width and length, and less than a quarter of an inch in height.
Start by creating a new coordinate system aligned with the default axes. Sketch a circle on the first face, then scale it down to fit the desired size. Transform this sketch into a three-dimensional object by extruding it to form a solid cylinder. The cylinder has a flat circular top and bottom, with a height of 0.01905 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a length of 0.75 units. This process results in a compact, cylindrical shape that can be used as a component in larger assemblies.
Create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero and a translation vector also set to zero. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face. In the first loop, draw a circle centered at coordinates (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.375. Apply a scale factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch to reduce its size proportionally. Transform the scaled two-dimensional sketch into three dimensions by rotating it using the same Euler angles and translating it with the same translation vector. Extrude the transformed sketch 0.019 units along the normal direction to create a solid body. Ensure that the extrusion does not occur in the opposite direction. The final dimensions of the cylinder will be a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.01905 units.
