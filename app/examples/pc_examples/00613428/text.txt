The object is a rectangular prism with a protruding rectangular section on one side and a smaller rectangular section on the top. The protruding section has a slight curve on its top edge.
The design consists of a rectangular prism with a protruding section and a smaller rectangular section on top, combined with a smaller rectangular prism that has a diagonal cut, forming a triangular section on one end. The final shape combines these parts to create a unique and functional form.
The first part involves creating a rectangular prism with a protruding section on one side and a smaller rectangular section on the top. The overall dimensions are approximately 0.75 units in length, 0.25 units in width, and 0.375 units in height. The second part involves constructing a smaller rectangular prism with a diagonal cut on one of its faces, forming a triangular section on one end. This part has dimensions of about 0.25 units in length, 0.0625 units in width, and 0.75 units in height. These two parts are then assembled together to form the final shape, with the second part being positioned to create the diagonal cut on the first part.
Create a new coordinate system for the first part by setting the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. On the first face, draw a closed loop consisting of fourteen lines. The first line starts at (0.0, 0.0) and ends at (0.75, 0.0). The second line starts at (0.75, 0.0) and ends at (0.75, 0.1875). Continue this process until the fourteenth line, which starts at (0.0, 0.25) and ends at (0.0, 0.0). Apply a scale factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch. Rotate the scaled sketch using the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, -90.0] and translate it using the translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Extrude the sketch 0.375 units in the direction opposite to the normal. The resulting shape is a rectangular prism with a protruding section on one side and a smaller rectangular section on the top. The dimensions are length: 0.7500000000000001, width: 0.25000000000000006, and height: 0.37500000000000006.

For the second part, create a new coordinate system by setting the Euler angles to [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and the translation vector to [0.75, 0.0625, 0.0]. On the first face, draw a closed loop consisting of six lines. The first line starts at (0.0, 0.0625) and ends at (0.0625, 0.0). The second line starts at (0.0625, 0.0) and ends at (0.1875, 0.0). Continue this process until the sixth line, which starts at (0.0625, 0.0625) and ends at (0.0, 0.0625). Apply a scale factor of 0.25 to the entire sketch. Rotate the scaled sketch using the Euler angles [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and translate it using the translation vector [0.75, 0.0625, 0.0]. Extrude the sketch 0.75 units in the direction opposite to the normal. Subtract the extruded shape from the existing body to create a diagonal cut on one of its faces, forming a triangular section on one end. The dimensions are length: 0.25, width: 0.0625, and height: 0.7500000000000001.
