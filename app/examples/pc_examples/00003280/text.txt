A square box with a hollow center and thick walls.
Design a square box with a hollow center and thick walls. The box measures about 0.75 units long, 0.66 units wide, and 0.12 units high. The inner hollow space ensures the walls are thick and sturdy.
The design involves creating a square box with a hollow center and thick walls. Start by setting up a new coordinate system and drawing a two-dimensional sketch that includes an outer rectangle and an inner rectangle. The outer rectangle forms the boundary of the box, while the inner rectangle defines the hollow center. After drawing the sketch, scale it down to fit the desired size. Transform the scaled sketch into a three-dimensional object and extrude it to create the final solid body. The final dimensions of the box are approximately 0.75 units in length, 0.6613 units in width, and 0.1216 units in height.
Create a new coordinate system with the Euler angles set to zero degrees for all axes and the translation vector set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.1216]. Begin by drawing the first two-dimensional sketch on the first face. This sketch consists of two loops. The outer rectangle, the first loop, starts at the origin (0.0, 0.0) and extends to (0.75, 0.0), then to (0.75, 0.6613), and finally back to the origin. The inner rectangle, the second loop, begins at (0.0405, 0.0405), moves to (0.7095, 0.0405), continues to (0.7095, 0.6208), and returns to the starting point. After completing the sketch, apply a scale factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch to adjust its size. Transform the scaled two-dimensional sketch into a three-dimensional object by rotating it using the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translating it using the vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.1216]. Finally, extrude the sketch 0.1216 units in the opposite direction of the normal to create a new solid body. The final dimensions of the model are a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.6613 units, and a height of 0.1216 units.
