The object is a cylindrical shape with two hexagonal cutouts on its surface. The cutouts are aligned vertically and are of equal size.
The design features a cylindrical shape with two hexagonal cutouts, one small and one large, creating a unique and functional form. The final model is compact, measuring about 0.75 units long, 0.41 units wide, and 0.73 units tall.
Start by creating a cylindrical shape with two hexagonal cutouts. The base of the cylinder has a rounded rectangular shape with a smaller hexagonal cutout near the center and a larger hexagonal cutout closer to the edge. After defining the initial shape, scale it down to fit the desired dimensions. The final model is then transformed into three-dimensional space and extruded to create a solid body. The final dimensions of the model are a length of approximately 0.75 units, a width of about 0.41 units, and a height of roughly 0.73 units.
Create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero degrees and a translation vector also set to zero. Begin by drawing a two-dimensional sketch on the first face. In the first loop, draw a line from the point (0.2066, 0.0) to (0.5434, 0.0), followed by an arc from (0.5434, 0.0) to (0.5434, 0.4133) with a midpoint at (0.75, 0.2066). Continue with a line from (0.5434, 0.4133) to (0.2066, 0.4133) and another arc from (0.2066, 0.4133) back to (0.2066, 0.0) with a midpoint at (0.0, 0.2066). For the second loop, draw a series of lines connecting the points (0.075, 0.1306), (0.2066, 0.0546), (0.3383, 0.1306), (0.3383, 0.2826), (0.2066, 0.3586), (0.075, 0.2826), and back to (0.075, 0.1306). In the third loop, draw lines connecting the points (0.473, 0.1483), (0.574, 0.09), (0.675, 0.1483), (0.675, 0.265), (0.574, 0.3233), (0.473, 0.265), and back to (0.473, 0.1483). Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled sketch into three-dimensional space using the same Euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the sketch 0.7347 units along the normal direction to create a new solid body. The final dimensions of the model are a length of 0.7500000000000001 units, a width of 0.41326530612244905 units, and a height of 0.7346938775510204 units.
