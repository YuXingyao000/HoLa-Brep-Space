A cylindrical object with a hollow center and rounded edges.
The design consists of a cylindrical base with a smooth surface and a flat, circular top. A hollow center is created within the cylinder, giving it a tube-like structure. The overall shape is a tall, round cylinder with a smaller, hollow section at the top.
The first part involves creating a cylindrical base with a smooth surface and rounded edges. The top surface is flat and circular. The dimensions of this cylinder are a length of 0.5605381165919281, a width of 0.5605381165919281, and a height of 0.7499999999999999. For the second part, a hollow center is constructed within the cylinder. This hollow section has a length of 0.22068429787083785, a width of 0.22068429787083785, and a height of 0.33102644680625676. The hollow center is created by removing material from the top of the cylinder, extending downwards. These two parts are combined to form the final cylindrical shape with a hollow core.
Create a new coordinate system for the first part by setting the Euler angles to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Next, draw a two-dimensional sketch on a single face. Within this face, draw a single loop and within this loop, draw a single circle. Set the center of the circle to [0.2803, 0.2803] and the radius to 0.2803. Apply a scaling factor of 0.5605 to the two-dimensional sketch. Since no transformation is needed due to the Euler angles and translation vector being set to zero, proceed to extrude the two-dimensional sketch 0.75 units along the normal direction to generate the three-dimensional model. Ensure that the extrusion does not occur in the opposite direction. This operation will create a new solid body with a length of 0.5605381165919281, a width of 0.5605381165919281, and a height of 0.7499999999999999.

For the second part, create another new coordinate system with Euler angles set to [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector to [0.1699, 0.1699, 0.75]. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on a single face, and within this face, draw a single loop and a single circle. Set the center of the circle to [0.1103, 0.1103] and the radius to 0.1103. Apply a scaling factor of 0.2207 to the two-dimensional sketch. As no transformation is required, extrude the two-dimensional sketch 0.331 units in the opposite direction of the normal to cut or remove material from the existing body. This operation will result in a hollow center with a length of 0.22068429787083785, a width of 0.22068429787083785, and a height of 0.33102644680625676.
