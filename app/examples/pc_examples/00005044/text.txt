A rectangular block with two cylindrical holes on its top surface. The block has a flat bottom and sharp edges.
The design features a rectangular block with two parallel cylindrical holes on its top surface and one cylindrical hole on its side. The block measures approximately 0.59 x 0.75 x 0.16 units, while the cylindrical holes are about 0.075 units in diameter and 0.31 units deep.
The design consists of three main parts. The first part is a rectangular block named Cube, which has a length of 0.5875, a width of 0.75, and a height of 0.1625. The second part involves creating two cylindrical holes, each with a diameter of 0.075 and a height of 0.3125, positioned parallel to each other on the top surface of the cube. The third part involves creating a single cylindrical hole with a diameter of 0.075 and a height of 0.3125, positioned near the center of the cube's side. These parts are combined to form a complex shape with a rectangular base and multiple cylindrical features.
In the first part, construct a rectangular block by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero and a translation vector also set to zero. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face, forming a loop with four lines: the first line starts at (0.0, 0.0) and ends at (0.5875, 0.0); the second line starts at (0.5875, 0.0) and ends at (0.5875, 0.75); the third line starts at (0.5875, 0.75) and ends at (0.0, 0.75); and the fourth line starts at (0.0, 0.75) and ends at (0.0, 0.0). Apply a scale factor of 0.75 to the sketch. Transform the sketch into three dimensions using the same Euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the sketch 0.1625 units along the normal direction to create a solid body named Cube with a length of 0.5875, a width of 0.75, and a height of 0.1625.

In the second part, construct two cylindrical holes by setting up a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [-90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.5875, 0.1, 0.0438]. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face, forming a loop with a circle centered at (0.0375, 0.0375) with a radius of 0.0375. On the second face, draw another loop with a circle centered at (0.5125, 0.0375) with the same radius. Apply a scale factor of 0.55 to the sketch. Transform the sketch into three dimensions using the specified Euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the sketch 0.3125 units in the opposite direction, removing material from the existing body where the cylinders intersect. Name this part Cylinder with a length of 0.55, a width of 0.075, and a height of 0.3125.

In the third part, construct a single cylindrical hole by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles of [90.0, 0.0, -90.0] and a translation vector of [0.0, 0.4125, 0.0438]. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face, forming a loop with an arc starting at (0.0, 0.0375), mid at (0.011, 0.011), and ending at (0.0375, 0.0), followed by two lines connecting the arc's endpoints. On the second face, draw another loop with two lines and an arc starting at (0.0375, 0.075), mid at (0.011, 0.064), and ending at (0.0, 0.0375). On the third face, draw a loop with an arc starting at (0.0375, 0.0), mid at (0.064, 0.011), and ending at (0.075, 0.0375), followed by two lines connecting the arc's endpoints. On the fourth face, draw a loop with two lines and an arc starting at (0.075, 0.0375), mid at (0.064, 0.064), and ending at (0.0375, 0.075). Apply a scale factor of 0.075 to the sketch. Transform the sketch into three dimensions using the specified Euler angles and translation vector. Extrude the sketch 0.3125 units in the opposite direction, removing material from the existing body where the cylinder intersects. Name this part Cylinder with a length of 0.075, a width of 0.075, and a height of 0.3125.
