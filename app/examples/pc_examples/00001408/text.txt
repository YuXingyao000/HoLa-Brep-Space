A rectangular prism with a slightly rounded top and bottom, and sharp edges.
Design a small rectangular prism that is about 0.0865 units wide and long, and 0.375 units tall.
Create a new coordinate system with the specified Euler angles and translation vector. Draw a square sketch on a new face and apply a scaling factor to adjust its size. Transform the sketch into a three-dimensional object by rotating and translating it according to the given parameters. Extrude the sketch to create a solid rectangular prism. The final dimensions of the prism are approximately 0.0865 units in length, 0.0865 units in width, and 0.375 units in height.
Start by creating a new coordinate system with the Euler angles set to 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees, and the translation vector set to 0.0, 0.375, 0.0. Next, draw a two-dimensional sketch on a new face. Begin by drawing a loop consisting of four lines: the first line starts at (0.0, 0.0) and ends at (0.0865, 0.0); the second line starts at (0.0865, 0.0) and ends at (0.0865, 0.0865); the third line starts at (0.0865, 0.0865) and ends at (0.0, 0.0865); and the fourth line starts at (0.0, 0.0865) and ends at (0.0, 0.0). Apply a scaling factor of 0.0865 to the entire sketch to adjust its size. Transform the two-dimensional sketch into a three-dimensional object by rotating it using the Euler angles 0.0, 0.0, and -90.0 degrees, and then translating it using the vector 0.0, 0.375, 0.0. Extrude the sketch 0.1875 units in both the normal direction and the opposite direction of the normal to create a new solid body. The final dimensions of the rectangular prism should be 0.08653846153846154 units in length, 0.08653846153846154 units in width, and 0.375 units in height.
