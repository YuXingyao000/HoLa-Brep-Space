A cylindrical object with a rectangular top and a pointed tip.
The design features a cylindrical object with a rectangular top and a pointed tip. The object is created by combining several shapes, including rectangles and curved lines, which are then transformed into a three-dimensional form. The final dimensions are roughly zero point two nine units in length, zero point seven three units in width, and zero point zero seven units in height.
The design involves creating a cylindrical object with a rectangular top and a pointed tip. Start by setting up a new coordinate system with specific Euler angles and a translation vector. The first face is a simple rectangle, while the second face includes a combination of lines and arcs to form a more complex shape. The third face is a smaller rectangle that connects to the second face. These faces are then scaled down, rotated, and translated to form the three-dimensional object. Finally, the object is extruded to create the final solid body. The final dimensions of the object are a length of approximately zero point two nine units, a width of around zero point seven three units, and a height of about zero point zero seven units.
Create a new coordinate system by setting the Euler angles to zero, zero, and negative ninety degrees, and the translation vector to zero, zero point zero six eight two, and zero point zero zero seven five units. In the first two-dimensional sketch, draw the first loop by creating a line from the origin at zero, zero point one nine zero one to zero point zero two six nine, zero point zero eight four four, then continue with a second line from there to zero point zero four seven three, zero point zero eight nine six, followed by a third line to zero point zero two zero four, zero point one nine five three, and finally a fourth line back to the origin. For the second two-dimensional sketch, start the first loop with a line from zero point zero two six nine, zero point zero eight four four to zero point zero four seven three, zero point zero eight nine six, then draw an arc from this point through zero point one eight, zero point zero one nine eight to zero point two three five seven, zero point one five eight nine. Continue with a line from this point to zero point zero three five six, zero point five six six eight, followed by an arc from there through zero point one zero three, zero point seven three five to zero point two six three three, zero point six five zero six. Add a line from this point to zero point two four two nine, zero point six four five four, and another arc from there through zero point one one zero three, zero point seven one five two to zero point zero five four five, zero point five seven six one. Complete the loop with a line from this point to zero point two five four six, zero point one six eight two, and an arc from there through zero point one eight seven two, zero to zero point zero two six nine, zero point zero eight four four. For the third two-dimensional sketch, draw the first loop starting with a line from zero point two four two nine, zero point six four five four to zero point two six nine eight, zero point five three nine seven, then add a second line from there to zero point two nine zero two, zero point five four four nine, followed by a third line to zero point two six three three, zero point six five zero six, and a fourth line back to the start. Scale the entire sketch by a factor of zero point seven three five. Transform the scaled two-dimensional sketch into three dimensions by rotating it using the Euler angles: zero, zero, and negative ninety degrees, and translating it using the vector: zero, zero point zero six eight two, and zero point zero zero seven five units. Extrude the sketch zero point zero six eight two units in the direction of the normal to create a new solid body. The final dimensions of the object are length: zero point two nine zero two two seven three four four three zero nine two three three nine seven units, width: zero point seven three four nine eight five seven one five six one seven three zero seven units, and height: zero point zero six eight one eight one eight one eight one eight one eight one eight units.
