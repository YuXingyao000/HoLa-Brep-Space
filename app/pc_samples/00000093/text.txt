The design is a three-armed, hollow, circular object with a flat base and rounded edges. It has a central circular section and three curved arms extending outward. The object is symmetrical and balanced, with a length of about 0.7154 units, a width of 0.6657 units, and a height of 0.0629 units.
The design involves creating a three-armed, hollow, circular object with a flat base and rounded edges. The object is constructed by defining a new coordinate system and drawing several two-dimensional sketches on different faces. These sketches consist of arcs and a circle, forming complex shapes that are then scaled and transformed into three dimensions. The final object has a length of approximately 0.7154 units, a width of about 0.6657 units, and a height of around 0.0629 units. The arms are connected to a central circular section, creating a symmetrical and balanced structure.
Create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero degrees and a translation vector of [0.0173, 0.0184, 0.0]. Begin by drawing the first two-dimensional sketch on the first face.

Next, draw the second face. In the first loop, draw twelve arcs: the first arc from (0.0739, 0.2664) to (0.0742, 0.234) with a midpoint at (0.0736, 0.2502), the second arc from (0.0742, 0.234) to (0.1998, 0.0164) with a midpoint at (0.2233, 0.175), the third arc from (0.1998, 0.0164) to (0.2277, 0.0) with a midpoint at (0.2135, 0.0078), the fourth arc from (0.2277, 0.0) to (0.4877, 0.0) with a midpoint at (0.3577, 0.1023), the fifth arc from (0.4877, 0.0) to (0.5156, 0.0164) with a midpoint at (0.5019, 0.0078), the sixth arc from (0.5156, 0.0164) to (0.6412, 0.234) with a midpoint at (0.4921, 0.175), the seventh arc from (0.6412, 0.234) to (0.6415, 0.2664) with a midpoint at (0.6418, 0.2502), the eighth arc from (0.6415, 0.2664) to (0.5115, 0.4915) with a midpoint at (0.4879, 0.3278), the ninth arc from (0.5115, 0.4915) to (0.4833, 0.5075) with a midpoint at (0.4976, 0.4999), the tenth arc from (0.4833, 0.5075) to (0.2321, 0.5075) with a midpoint at (0.3577, 0.4078), the eleventh arc from (0.2321, 0.5075) to (0.2039, 0.4915) with a midpoint at (0.2178, 0.4999), and the twelfth arc from (0.2039, 0.4915) to (0.0739, 0.2664) with a midpoint at (0.2275, 0.3278).

Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.7154. Apply the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and the translation vector [0.0173, 0.0184, 0.0] to transform the scaled sketch into three dimensions. Extrude the sketch 0.0629 units in the direction of the normal and 0.0 units in the opposite direction to create a new solid body. The final dimensions of the object are: length 0.715449087225419 units, width 0.6656995659897668 units, and height 0.06294318761293798 units.
