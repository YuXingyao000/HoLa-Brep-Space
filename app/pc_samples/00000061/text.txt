A cube with a corner cut out, resulting in a square base and a triangular top. The cut-out corner is rounded.
Design a cube with a small cutout at one corner. The cube measures 0.75 units in length and width, with a height of 0.0375 units. The cutout creates a smooth, rounded edge, giving the cube a unique and functional shape.
Create a new coordinate system with default settings. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face, forming a rectangular shape with a small cutout at one corner. The main body of the sketch is a rectangle, and a smaller section is removed from one corner, creating a smooth transition with an arc. Scale the entire sketch to reduce its size. Transform the scaled sketch into a three-dimensional object by extruding it along the normal direction. The final part has a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.75 units, and a height of 0.0375 units. This forms a cube with a corner cut out, integrating seamlessly into the final design.
Start by setting up a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero degrees and a translation vector also set to zero. Next, draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face. Begin with the first loop, drawing the first line from the origin (0.0, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0). Continue by drawing the second line from (0.75, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.75). The third line should extend from (0.75, 0.75) to (0.075, 0.75). Then, draw the first arc starting at (0.075, 0.75), passing through (0.053, 0.697), and ending at (0.0, 0.675). Finally, draw the fourth line from (0.0, 0.675) back to the origin. After completing the sketch, apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch. Since the Euler angles and translation vector are already set to zero, no further transformation is needed. Extrude the scaled sketch 0.0375 units along the normal direction, ensuring that the extrusion does not occur in the opposite direction. Create a new solid body using the extruded sketch. The final dimensions of the part are 0.75 units in length, 0.75 units in width, and 0.0375 units in height.
