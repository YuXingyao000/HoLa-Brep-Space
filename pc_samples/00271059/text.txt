The object is a rectangular shape with rounded edges and a central circular hole. It has two raised circular elements on its surface.
The design includes a rectangular block with a hole in the middle and two small, flat washers attached to its top. The block is about 0.75 units long and 0.35 units wide, while the washers are roughly 0.35 units long and 0.15 units wide.
The design consists of two main parts: a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole and a pair of flat washers. The rectangular prism has a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.3454 units, and a height of 0.0987 units. It features a cylindrical hole through its center. The pair of flat washers, positioned near the top of the rectangular prism, each have a length of 0.3464 units, a width of 0.1490 units, and a height of 0.0099 units. These washers are placed side by side, aligned with the rectangular prism, forming a cohesive assembly.
Create a rectangular prism with a cylindrical hole by first setting up a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero and a translation vector also set to zero. Next, draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face. In the first loop, start with a line from (0.1727, 0.0) to (0.7007, 0.0), followed by an arc starting at (0.7007, 0.0), with a midpoint at (0.7355, 0.0145), and ending at (0.75, 0.0493). Continue with another line from (0.75, 0.0493) to (0.75, 0.2961), then an arc from (0.75, 0.2961) to (0.7007, 0.3454), and a line from (0.7007, 0.3454) to (0.1727, 0.3454). Finish the loop with an arc from (0.1727, 0.3454) to (0.1727, 0.0). In the second loop, draw a circle centered at (0.1727, 0.1727) with a radius of 0.1234. Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled sketch into three dimensions by rotating it using Euler angles set to zero and translating it with a vector also set to zero. Extrude the sketch 0.0987 units along the normal direction and 0.0 units in the opposite direction to create a new solid body. The final dimensions of the rectangular prism are a length of 0.75 units, a width of 0.3453947368421053 units, and a height of 0.09868421052631579 units.

For the second part, construct a pair of flat washers by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero and a translation vector of [0.3498, 0.0982, 0.0987]. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face. In the first loop, draw a circle centered at (0.0745, 0.0745) with a radius of 0.0745. In the second loop, draw a smaller circle centered at the same point with a radius of 0.037. On the second face, repeat the process with a circle centered at (0.2719, 0.0745) with a radius of 0.0745 and a smaller circle centered at the same point with a radius of 0.037. Scale the entire sketch by a factor of 0.3464. Transform the scaled sketch into three dimensions by rotating it using Euler angles set to zero and translating it with the specified vector. Extrude the sketch 0.0099 units along the normal direction and 0.0 units in the opposite direction, adding the extruded shape to the existing body. The final dimensions of the washers are a length of 0.34638157894736854 units, a width of 0.14901315789473685 units, and a height of 0.009868421052631578 units.
