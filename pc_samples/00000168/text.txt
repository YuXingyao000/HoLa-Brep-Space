The object is a rectangular prism with a curved top and a cutout on one side. It has a flat base and a smooth, curved surface on top.
The design features a rectangular prism with a curved top and a cutout on one side. It measures roughly zero point seven five units long, zero point four five units wide, and zero point five six units tall.
Start by creating a new coordinate system with specific Euler angles and a translation vector. On the first face, draw a loop that outlines the base of the model, including a straight section, a smaller rectangular section, and a curved section. After completing the loop, scale the sketch to reduce its size. Transform the scaled sketch into a three-dimensional shape by rotating and translating it according to the specified angles and vectors. Finally, extrude the sketch to create a solid body. The resulting model is a rectangular prism with a curved top and a cutout on one side. The dimensions of the final model are approximately zero point seven five units in length, zero point four five three one units in width, and zero point five six two five units in height.
Create a new coordinate system by setting the Euler angles to zero, zero, and negative ninety degrees, and the translation vector to zero, zero point five six two five, and zero. On the first face, draw the first loop starting with the first line from the origin to zero point seven five, zero. Continue with the second line from zero point seven five, zero to zero point seven five, zero point zero six two five. Draw the third line from zero point seven five, zero point zero six two five to zero point five six two five, zero point zero six two five. The fourth line should extend from zero point five six two five, zero point zero six two five to zero point five six two five, zero point four five three one. Draw the fifth line from zero point five six two five, zero point four five three one to zero point five three one three, zero point four five three one. The sixth element is an arc from zero point five three one three, zero point four five three one to zero point two one eight eight, zero point four five three one, with a midpoint at zero point three seven five, zero point two nine six nine. Follow this with the seventh line from zero point two one eight eight, zero point four five three one to zero point one eight seven five, zero point four five three one. The eighth line extends from zero point one eight seven five, zero point four five three one to zero point one eight seven five, zero point zero six two five. Complete the loop with the ninth line from zero point one eight seven five, zero point zero six two five to zero, zero point zero six two five, and finally, the tenth line from zero, zero point zero six two five back to the origin. Scale the entire first two-dimensional sketch by a factor of zero point seven five. Rotate the scaled sketch using the Euler angles: zero, zero, and negative ninety degrees, and translate it using the vector: zero, zero point five six two five, and zero. Extrude the transformed sketch zero point five six two five units along the normal direction to create a new solid body. The final dimensions of the rectangular prism with a curved top and a cutout on one side are length: zero point seven five zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one units, width: zero point four five three one two five zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero six units, and height: zero point five six two five zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one units.
