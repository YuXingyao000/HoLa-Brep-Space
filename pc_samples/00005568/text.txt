The object is a cube with a smaller cube protruding from one of its faces. The protruding cube has a circular hole in its center. The main cube has three circular holes on its surface.
The design consists of two parts: a larger cube with several circular holes and a smaller cube with a cylindrical hole. These parts are combined to form a complex shape. The larger cube measures about 0.75 units in length, 0.406 units in width, and 0.3125 units in height. The smaller cube measures about 0.425 units in length, width, and height.
The first part involves creating a cube with circular holes. The cube has a length of approximately 0.75 units, a width of approximately 0.406 units, and a height of 0.3125 units. Multiple circular holes are positioned within the cube to create a specific pattern. The second part adds a smaller cube with a cylindrical hole to the existing body. This smaller cube has a length, width, and height of approximately 0.425 units, 0.425 units, and 0.381 units, respectively. Both parts are aligned and combined to form the final complex shape.
Create a new coordinate system for the first part with Euler angles set to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and a translation vector of 0.0, 0.3812, 0.0. On the first face, draw the first loop consisting of six curves: an arc starting at (0.0, 0.0125) and ending at (0.0125, 0.0), a line from (0.0125, 0.0) to (0.7375, 0.0), another arc from (0.7375, 0.0) to (0.75, 0.0125), a line from (0.75, 0.0125) to (0.75, 0.3937), an arc from (0.75, 0.3937) to (0.7375, 0.4062), a line from (0.7375, 0.4062) to (0.0125, 0.4062), an arc from (0.0125, 0.4062) to (0.0, 0.3937), and a line from (0.0, 0.3937) to (0.0, 0.0125). Add four additional loops, each consisting of a single circle: the second loop with a center at (0.0875, 0.0875) and a radius of 0.025, the third loop with a center at (0.0875, 0.275) and a radius of 0.025, the fourth loop with a center at (0.375, 0.275) and a radius of 0.0812, and the fifth loop with a center at (0.6625, 0.0875) and a radius of 0.025, and the sixth loop with a center at (0.6625, 0.275) and a radius of 0.025. Apply a scale factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch. Rotate the scaled sketch using Euler angles 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and translate it using the translation vector 0.0, 0.3812, 0.0. Extrude the sketch 0.3125 units towards the normal without extruding in the opposite direction. This will create a new solid body with dimensions: length 0.7499999999999999, width 0.40624999999999994, and height 0.3125.

For the second part, create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and a translation vector of 0.1625, 0.3812, 0.0625. On the first face, draw the first loop consisting of six curves: an arc starting at (0.0, 0.0125) and ending at (0.0125, 0.0), a line from (0.0125, 0.0) to (0.4125, 0.0), another arc from (0.4125, 0.0) to (0.425, 0.0125), a line from (0.425, 0.0125) to (0.425, 0.4125), an arc from (0.425, 0.4125) to (0.4125, 0.425), a line from (0.4125, 0.425) to (0.0125, 0.425), an arc from (0.0125, 0.425) to (0.0, 0.4125), and a line from (0.0, 0.4125) to (0.0, 0.0125). Add a second loop consisting of a single circle with a center at (0.2125, 0.2125) and a radius of 0.0812. Apply a scale factor of 0.425 to the entire sketch. Rotate the scaled sketch using Euler angles 0.0, 0.0, -90.0 and translate it using the translation vector 0.1625, 0.3812, 0.0625. Extrude the sketch 0.3812 units towards the normal without extruding in the opposite direction. This will add material to the existing body with dimensions: length 0.425, width 0.425, and height 0.3812499999999999.
