A cylinder with a slightly curved top and bottom edges. The top surface is slightly tilted compared to the bottom.
This design features a cylinder with gently curved edges. The cylinder has a square base and stands 0.75 units tall, with each side of the base measuring 0.4162 units. The curved edges add a smooth and elegant touch to the overall shape.
The design involves creating a three-dimensional cylinder with slightly curved top and bottom edges. Start by defining a new coordinate system with no rotation or translation. Draw a two-dimensional sketch on the first face, consisting of a series of lines and arcs that form a closed loop. This loop is then scaled down to fit the desired dimensions. The scaled sketch is transformed into a three-dimensional object by extruding it 0.75 units along the normal direction. The resulting solid has a square base with sides measuring 0.4162 units and a height of 0.75 units. The curved edges give the cylinder a unique and smooth appearance.
Create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero and a translation vector also set to zero. For the first face, start by drawing the first loop. Begin with the first line from the origin (0.0, 0.0) to (0.1908, 0.0). Follow this with the first arc, which should extend from (0.1908, 0.0) to (0.4162, 0.2254) with a midpoint at (0.3502, 0.066). Next, draw the second line from (0.4162, 0.2254) to (0.4162, 0.4162). Continue with the third line from (0.4162, 0.4162) to (0.1387, 0.4162). Then, draw the second arc from (0.1387, 0.4162) to (0.0, 0.2775) with a midpoint at (0.0406, 0.3756). Finally, complete the loop with the fourth line from (0.0, 0.2775) back to the origin. Scale the entire two-dimensional sketch by a factor of 0.4162. Rotate and translate the scaled sketch using the same Euler angles and translation vector as initially set. Extrude the scaled and transformed two-dimensional sketch 0.75 units along the normal direction to create the three-dimensional model. Ensure that the extrusion does not occur in the opposite direction. Create a new solid body from this extrusion. The final dimensions of the model will be a length of 0.4162, a width of 0.4162, and a height of 0.75.
