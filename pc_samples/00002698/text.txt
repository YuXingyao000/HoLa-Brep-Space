The object is a cylindrical base with a rectangular top. The top has a circular hole in the center.
The design features a cylindrical base with a rectangular top. The top has a small circular hole in the center. The base and top are combined to form a unique shape.
The design involves creating two parts that are combined to form the final shape. The first part is a circular plate with a central hole. This plate has a length and width of 0.75 units and a height of 0.065625 units. The second part is a cube-shaped object with a cylindrical hole in the center. This cube has a length and width of 0.140625 units and a height of 0.253125 units. The two parts are assembled such that the cube-shaped object sits on top of the circular plate, with the circular hole aligned with the central hole of the plate. The final shape is a cylindrical base with a rectangular top, and the top has a circular hole in the center.
Create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero degrees and a translation vector also set to zero. For the first face, draw a circle with a center at (0.375, 0.375) and a radius of 0.375. Next, draw a rectangle with the following lines: start the first line at (0.3047, 0.3047) and end at (0.4453, 0.3047); continue with the second line from (0.4453, 0.3047) to (0.4453, 0.4453); the third line from (0.4453, 0.4453) to (0.3047, 0.4453); and the fourth line from (0.3047, 0.4453) back to (0.3047, 0.3047). For the second face, draw a rectangle with the same dimensions and a circle centered at (0.375, 0.375) with a radius of 0.0469. For the third face, draw two concentric circles, both centered at (0.375, 0.375), with radii of 0.0469 and 0.0234, respectively. Apply a scaling factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch. Rotate the scaled sketch using the Euler angles set to zero degrees and translate it using the translation vector set to zero. Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.0656 units without extruding in the opposite direction. Create a new solid body from the extruded sketch. The dimensions of this part are length 0.75, width 0.75, and height 0.065625. For the second part, create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero degrees and a translation vector of (0.3047, 0.3047, 0.0). Draw a rectangle with the following lines: start the first line at (0.0, 0.0) and end at (0.1406, 0.0); continue with the second line from (0.1406, 0.0) to (0.1406, 0.1406); the third line from (0.1406, 0.1406) to (0.0, 0.1406); and the fourth line from (0.0, 0.1406) back to (0.0, 0.0). Draw a circle centered at (0.0703, 0.0703) with a radius of 0.0469. Apply a scaling factor of 0.1406 to the entire sketch. Rotate the scaled sketch using the Euler angles set to zero degrees and translate it using the translation vector of (0.3047, 0.3047, 0.0). Extrude the sketch along the normal by 0.2531 units without extruding in the opposite direction. Add the extruded sketch to the existing body. The dimensions of this part are length 0.140625, width 0.140625, and height 0.253125. The final shape consists of a cylindrical base with a rectangular top, and the top has a circular hole in the center.
