A rectangular tub with rounded edges and corners. The tub has a flat bottom and an open top.
The design consists of a large rectangular tub with rounded edges and corners. Inside, a smaller rectangular shape is used to create the inner cavity, resulting in a tub with a flat bottom and an open top.
The design involves two main parts. The first part is a larger cube with rounded edges and corners, measuring 0.5526 meters in length, 0.75 meters in width, and 0.4737 meters in height. This part forms the outer shell of the tub. The second part is a smaller cube with rounded edges and corners, measuring 0.4737 meters in length, 0.6711 meters in width, and 0.4342 meters in height. This part is positioned inside the larger cube and is used to remove material, creating the inner cavity of the tub. The final shape is a rectangular tub with rounded edges and corners, featuring a flat bottom and an open top.
Start by creating a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero degrees and a translation vector of zero meters. Draw the first 2D sketch on the first face, which consists of a loop with four arcs and four lines forming a rectangle with rounded corners. The first arc starts at (0.0, 0.0592), passes through (0.0173, 0.0173), and ends at (0.0592, 0.0). The first line runs from (0.0592, 0.0) to (0.4934, 0.0). The second arc begins at (0.4934, 0.0), goes through (0.5353, 0.0173), and concludes at (0.5526, 0.0592). The second line extends from (0.5526, 0.0592) to (0.5526, 0.6908). The third arc starts at (0.5526, 0.6908), passes through (0.5353, 0.7327), and ends at (0.4934, 0.75). The third line runs from (0.4934, 0.75) to (0.0592, 0.75). The fourth arc begins at (0.0592, 0.75), goes through (0.0173, 0.7327), and concludes at (0.0, 0.6908). The fourth line extends from (0.0, 0.6908) back to (0.0, 0.0592). Scale this 2D sketch by a factor of 0.75. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the same coordinate system settings. Extrude the 2D sketch along the normal direction by 0.4737 meters to create a new solid body.

Next, create another new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero degrees and a translation vector of [0.0395, 0.0395, 0.4737] meters. Draw the second 2D sketch on the first face, which also consists of a loop with four arcs and four lines forming a smaller rectangle with rounded corners. The first arc starts at (0.0, 0.0592), passes through (0.0173, 0.0173), and ends at (0.0592, 0.0). The first line runs from (0.0592, 0.0) to (0.4145, 0.0). The second arc begins at (0.4145, 0.0), goes through (0.4563, 0.0173), and concludes at (0.4737, 0.0592). The second line extends from (0.4737, 0.0592) to (0.4737, 0.6118). The third arc starts at (0.4737, 0.6118), passes through (0.4563, 0.6537), and ends at (0.4145, 0.6711). The third line runs from (0.4145, 0.6711) to (0.0592, 0.6711). The fourth arc begins at (0.0592, 0.6711), goes through (0.0173, 0.6537), and concludes at (0.0, 0.6118). The fourth line extends from (0.0, 0.6118) back to (0.0, 0.0592). Scale this 2D sketch by a factor of 0.6711. Transform the scaled 2D sketch into 3D using the same coordinate system settings. Extrude the 2D sketch in the opposite normal direction by 0.4342 meters to remove material from the existing body. The final shape is a rectangular tub with rounded edges and corners, featuring a flat bottom and an open top.
