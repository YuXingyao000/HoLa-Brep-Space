A rectangular plate with a central oval hole and two holes at the ends.
The design features a rectangular plate with a central oval hole and two small circular holes at each end. The plate is thin and has a specific length and width, making it suitable for precise applications.
The design involves creating a rectangular plate with a central oval hole and two smaller circular holes at each end. The plate is defined by its length, width, and height, which are 0.7500000000000001 units, 0.15625000000000003 units, and 0.015625000000000003 units, respectively. The central oval hole is positioned in the middle of the plate, while the two smaller circular holes are located at the ends. These features are created by sketching the outlines and then extruding them to form the final 3D shape.
Create a new coordinate system with Euler angles set to zero degrees and a translation vector also set to zero. On the first face, draw the first loop as a rectangle with the following lines: the first line starts at (0.0, 0.0) and ends at (0.75, 0.0); the second line starts at (0.75, 0.0) and ends at (0.75, 0.1563); the third line starts at (0.75, 0.1563) and ends at (0.0, 0.1563); the fourth line starts at (0.0, 0.1563) and ends at (0.0, 0.0). In the second loop, draw a circle centered at (0.0375, 0.0781) with a radius of 0.0134. For the third loop, draw an oval using the following segments: the first line starts at (0.25, 0.0313) and ends at (0.5, 0.0313); the first arc starts at (0.5, 0.0313), has a midpoint at (0.5469, 0.0781), and ends at (0.5, 0.125); the second line starts at (0.5, 0.125) and ends at (0.25, 0.125); the second arc starts at (0.25, 0.125), has a midpoint at (0.2031, 0.0781), and ends at (0.25, 0.0313). In the fourth loop, draw a circle centered at (0.7125, 0.0785) with a radius of 0.0134. Apply a scale factor of 0.75 to the entire sketch. Rotate the scaled sketch using the Euler angles [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] and translate it using the translation vector [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]. Extrude the sketch 0.0156 units in the positive normal direction to create a new solid body. The final dimensions of the rectangular plate with a central oval hole and two end holes are: length of 0.7500000000000001 units, width of 0.15625000000000003 units, and height of 0.015625000000000003 units.
