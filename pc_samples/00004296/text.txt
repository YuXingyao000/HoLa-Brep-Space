A rectangular object with rounded edges and a slightly protruding bottom edge.
This design features a rectangular object with rounded edges and a slight protrusion at the bottom. It measures roughly fifty-three millimeters long, seventy millimeters wide, and thirty-two millimeters high.
The part consists of a rectangular object with rounded edges and a slightly protruding bottom edge. The main body is created by extruding a rectangular sketch to form a solid. The dimensions of the part are approximately fifty-three millimeters in length, seventy millimeters in width, and thirty-two millimeters in height. The part is oriented and positioned using a specific coordinate system and transformation parameters to achieve the desired shape and alignment.
Create a new coordinate system by setting the Euler angles to zero, zero, and negative ninety degrees. Set the translation vector to negative twenty-four point five millimeters, thirty-one point eight millimeters, and twenty-one point two millimeters. Next, draw a two-dimensional sketch on a new face. Begin by drawing the first loop with four lines: start at the origin, draw a line to fifty-three point zero seven millimeters along the x-axis, then draw a vertical line up to seventy point seven five millimeters along the y-axis, continue with a horizontal line back to the origin along the x-axis, and finally, close the loop by drawing a vertical line down to the origin. Scale the entire sketch by a factor of seventy point seven five percent. Transform the scaled sketch into a three-dimensional object by rotating it using the Euler angles (zero, zero, negative ninety degrees) and translating it using the vector (negative twenty-four point five millimeters, thirty-one point eight millimeters, twenty-one point two millimeters). Extrude the transformed sketch thirty-one point eight millimeters in the direction of the normal to create a solid body. The final dimensions of the part are: length of fifty-three point zero seven millimeters, width of seventy point seven five millimeters, and height of thirty-one point eight millimeters.
