The object is an L-shaped CAD model with three steps. The first step is the largest, and each subsequent step is smaller, forming a right angle. The object has a smooth, rectangular shape with sharp edges.
The design involves creating an L-shaped part with a length of about three-quarters of a unit, a width slightly less than three-quarters of a unit, and a height of just over one-third of a unit. This part will be a crucial piece in the final assembly.
Start by creating a new coordinate system with specific rotations and translations. Draw a complex 2D sketch that forms an L-shape with several straight lines. After drawing, scale the sketch down to make it smaller. Then, rotate and translate the sketch to position it correctly in 3D space. Extrude the sketch to create a solid body. The final part has a length of zero point seven five units, a width of zero point seven one eight one units, and a height of zero point three two four three units. This part forms a key component of the larger L-shaped model.
Create a new coordinate system by setting the Euler angles to zero degrees, zero degrees, and negative ninety degrees, and set the translation vector to zero, zero point three two four three, and zero. For the first face, draw the first loop starting with the first line from the origin to the point zero point seven five, zero. Continue with the second line from zero point seven five, zero to zero point seven five, zero point two two zero seven. Draw the third line from zero point seven five, zero point two two zero seven to zero point four four three nine, zero point two two zero seven. Add the fourth line from zero point four four three nine, zero point two two zero seven to zero point four four three nine, zero point four seven three two. Draw the fifth line from zero point four four three nine, zero point four seven three two to zero point two four seven four, zero point four seven three two. Add the sixth line from zero point two four seven four, zero point four seven three two to zero point two four seven four, zero point seven one eight one. Draw the seventh line from zero point two four seven four, zero point seven one eight one to the origin. Finally, draw the eighth line back to the origin. Scale the entire sketch by a factor of zero point seven five. Rotate the scaled sketch using the Euler angles zero degrees, zero degrees, and negative ninety degrees, and translate it using the vector zero, zero point three two four three, and zero. Extrude the transformed sketch along the normal direction by zero point three two four three units without extruding in the opposite direction. This operation will create a new solid body. The dimensions of the final part are zero point seven five units in length, zero point seven one eight one units in width, and zero point three two four three units in height.
